# Hashing
A basic hashing algorithm which uses matrix solving and multiplication

This hashing algortihm uses matrix multiplication and matrix solving algorithm to hash the given string to the specified length.
The process is irreversible as the original string cannot be obtained using the hashed string. This is because ofn the usage of non invertible martix.
As the specified length of the hashed string increases, confliction decreases.

This hashing algorithm can be mainly used to hash the passwords and store it in the cloud to incease the security and decrease the risk of hacking of accounts.
